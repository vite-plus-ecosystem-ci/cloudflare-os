# `ui` — DOM helpers for document-style gadgets

The Docs, Sheets and Slides blueprints share the same few helpers: an element builder, an SVG icon
factory, toolbar buttons and a dropdown, an in-page prompt (the sandboxed iframe blocks
`window.prompt`), a save-status dot, relative timestamps, and the reading and downscaling of a
pasted image. This library is those helpers once, imported as
`@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/ui/client`. It is DOM-only: nothing here talks RPC
or touches storage, and nothing here knows what a click means -- every control takes the gadget's
action as an argument.

`@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/ui/server` exists so that every library has both entries and a
blueprint's server may import any of them uniformly. It exports one flag, `clientOnly`, and nothing
else.

Every element is styled by the gadget's own stylesheet through the class names above; the library
ships no CSS but `PROMPT_STYLES`.

## Behaviour worth knowing

- **`el`** has no `data` prop; write a `data-x` attribute. `text` sets `textContent` before the
  children are appended, so both may be given.
- **`iconBtn`/`segBtn`** prevent mousedown so the editor's selection survives the click;
  **`customSelect`**'s button does not, and a gadget whose selection has to survive it adds that
  listener to the returned element, as Docs does on its colour button. The dropdown's label for a
  value no option carries is the first choice's.
- **`promptInline`**'s message is text, not markup.
- **`prepareImage`** tries four encoding qualities before it shrinks the image, and keeps a GIF
  animated only while its data URL fits `maxGifDataUrlLength`. A gadget with its own conversion
  (Slides passes SVG through, keeps PNG as PNG and falls back to the original on any failure) uses
  `readFileAsDataURL` and `loadImage` and does the rest itself.
- **`relativeTime`** has no caller among the bundled blueprints yet.

## Tests

`__tests__/` covers every export in jsdom (`time.test.ts` in node). jsdom decodes no images and
draws on no canvas, so `images.test.ts` stands in an `Image` that reports the size written in its
source and a canvas whose data URL is as long as the requested quality and pixel count say.
