/**
 * The sync library's browser entry (`@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/sync/client`): what a
 * gadget's `client.js` needs to keep one Durable Object and many browsers in step, without any of
 * the gadget's own model.
 *
 * - {@link SaveScheduler} debounces, serializes and retries saves; the gadget says what is dirty
 *   and how to send it.
 * - {@link PresenceRoster} and {@link PresenceReporter} keep and report who is where, on the
 *   shared heartbeat, staleness and throttle constants; the gadget draws the result.
 * - {@link createSubscriber} builds the `RpcTarget` the server calls back, over the class the
 *   gadget's bootstrap provides.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the DOM: every module is driven through the functions the gadget passes in
 * and is tested in Node.
