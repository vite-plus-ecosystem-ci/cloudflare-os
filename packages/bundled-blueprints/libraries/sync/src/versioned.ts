/**
 * Optimistic concurrency over a set of items, each carrying its own `version`.
 *
 * A client sends, per item, the version it last saw (`baseVersion`); the server applies the batch
 * in order against its current items:
 *
 * - an item whose `baseVersion` no longer matches is *rejected* as `stale` and the authoritative
 *   item is returned, so the client can rebase its draft onto it rather than lose it;
 * - an item that is gone -- deleted by someone else since the client saw it -- is rejected as
 *   `missing`, and the client may re-create it from its draft (a writer's text wins over a
 *   deleter's absence) by sending it again with `baseVersion` 0;
 * - an accepted item takes the next version after the one it replaced (1 for a new one);
 * - an item identical to what is stored is neither a change nor a conflict;
 * - a deletion is version-checked the same way, so a delete never destroys what it has not seen,
 *   and deleting what is already gone is nothing at all.
 *
 * Nothing here knows what an item holds beyond its `id` and `version`: a page's block, a sheet's
 * cell and a deck's slide are all versioned this way, and the gadget keeps its own rules for
 * everything else (ordering, titles, structure), which are typically last-writer-wins.
