/**
 * The browsers subscribed to one Durable Object, and how events reach them.
 *
 * A subscriber arrives as the client's `RpcTarget`, seen from here through a Workers RPC stub that
 * is only valid for the call that delivered it. Keeping it means `dup()`-ing it, and dropping it
 * means disposing that copy; the runtime's `onRpcBroken` says when the connection behind it went
 * away. Delivery isolates subscribers from each other and from the object: a broadcast is issued to
 * everyone at once and never awaited, so one whose call fails is dropped rather than failing the
 * mutation that was being broadcast (and the rest are told it left, exactly as they would be had
 * its connection closed), one that never answers holds up nothing but itself, and a callback may
 * itself call back into the object -- read the document, queue another mutation -- without
 * deadlocking on the mutation that is telling it about the last one. Because deliveries are issued
 * synchronously, in call order, each subscriber still hears events in the order they were sent.
 *
 * Presence is the one thing the registry knows how to say itself, through the optional
 * {@link PresenceHooks}: a newcomer is first told about everyone already here, then announced to
 * everyone, and whoever drops out is announced as gone. What a "join" or "leave" looks like on the
 * wire is the gadget's, so the hooks express it in the gadget's own callback vocabulary. A gadget
 * with no presence (a deck everyone sees the same way) passes no hooks and gets a plain fan-out.
