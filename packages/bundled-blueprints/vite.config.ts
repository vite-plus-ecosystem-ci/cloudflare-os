         * Five type-check programs, one per set of globals, because the sets must not see each other:
         * a Durable Object has no `document`, iframe code cannot import `cloudflare:workers`, and
         * neither has Node's `fs`. Each is its own command so each reports on its own; the configs
         * say why they are split the way they are. Pure type checks: nothing here emits.
         *
         * - `tsconfig.client.json`: every blueprint's and library's client entry under the DOM lib.
         * - `tsconfig.server.json`: every server entry under the Workers types.
         * - `tsconfig.tests.json`: the blueprints' and libraries' own tests under DOM and Node types.
         * - `tsconfig.server-tests.json`: the tests of a server side, under Workers and Node types.
         * - `tsconfig.node.json`: `src/` (the build) and its tests, as the Node programs they are.
         *
         * The backend's `build:bundled-blueprints` task bundles the same blueprint sources with esbuild,
         * so a module the bundler cannot resolve fails there, and a type error fails here.
