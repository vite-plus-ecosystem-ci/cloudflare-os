# `@gadgets/gatekeeper-kit`

Shared building blocks for gatekeeper connect flows, credentials, actions, observations, cursors,
caching, and simulation. These modules replace security-sensitive plumbing that gatekeepers had
implemented separately.

The kit provides a pragmatic baseline for common gatekeeper behavior. Provider-specific or esoteric
behavior can use the canonical TypeScript interfaces directly while retaining whichever leaf
modules still fit.

## Current scope

Only Layer 1 is shipped: independent leaf modules exposed through package subpaths. Import them à la
carte; none requires a gatekeeper assembly.

Layer 2, including `KitUserAccountBase`, `KitVendorBase`, and `KitGatekeeperBase`, remains a proposal
in [`plans/gatekeeper-kit.md`](../../plans/gatekeeper-kit.md). No gatekeeper consumes it.

The code and tests define the shipped behavior. The plan records the design and the unshipped
proposal.

## Responsibility boundary

The kit owns provider-independent mechanisms inside each imported module. The gatekeeper owns
provider facts, policy, and the assembly around those modules. Importing a leaf does not transfer
the duties in the right-hand column.
Workshop owns connect completion ticket minting and redemption.

| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assembly and lifetime                   | Independent leaf contracts; no Layer 2 assembly is shipped.                                                                            | Worker, account, and resource-facet RPC surfaces; stub disposal; keeping stateful kit objects stable for one Durable Object activation.                     |
| Connect                                 | Nonce generation and comparison, the two-stage handshake, staged reconnect escrow, hardened handoff HTML, and browser mutation guards. | Provider exchange, staged payload shape, exact live commit, provider cleanup policy, routes, and authorization parameters.                                  |
| Preview OAuth                           | Signed state, stable-to-preview callback relay, and return-host validation.                                                            | Deployment configuration, provider callback parameters, issuer checks, and retaining the exact redirect URI for code exchange.                              |
| Credentials                             | Atomic credential records, refresh coalescing, identity and connection generations, replay, and rejection adjudication.                | Grant shape and projection, token exchange, provider error classification, refresh-field merging, revocation, and display-safe errors.                      |
| Credential expiry and simple auth retry | Durable deduplication of expiry notifications and one-refresh/one-replay helpers.                                                      | Deciding what proves grant expiry, provider refresh and revoke calls, and choosing the coordinator flow versus the standalone retry helper.                 |
| Actions                                 | Durable submission and resolution, serialization, journaling, retention mechanics, connection fences, and dependency tracking.         | Approval text, provider calls, idempotency and reconciliation, action-specific simulation, revert semantics, and retention policy.                          |
| Action files                            | Bounded chunk storage, integrity verification, aggregate accounting, deletion, and orphan-pruning mechanics.                           | Byte limits and key prefixes, keeping references in action records, describing the same bytes that will be applied, and releasing files with their records. |
| Simulation                              | Ordered pending-action views, pure replay with explicit incomplete results, and durable provisional-ID allocation and binding.         | Target extraction, state transitions, unsupported-effect policy, provider ID syntax, and projecting pending effects onto every affected read.               |
| Observations                            | Admission strategies, tracked-collection fencing, exclusion derivation, and the guarded authorization call.                            | Calling the gate for every read, truthful escaped descriptions, choosing the matching strategy and scope, ACL oracles, and collection canonicalization.     |
| Cursors                                 | Serialized walks, buffering, common page/offset/token continuation, filtering hooks, and per-page authorization callbacks.             | Provider page adapters, page limits and termination semantics, resource lifetime, and the observation description for each returned page.                   |
| Cache                                   | Authority partitioning, stale-fill fencing, TTL storage, single-flight loads, and invalidation.                                        | Cache families, names and keys, authority dimensions, TTLs, value projection, and deciding which reads are safe to cache.                                   |
| HTTP endpoints and responses            | Operator-supplied endpoint normalization, common no-access probes, and byte-capped text decoding.                                      | Host allowlists, redirect and header policy, response schemas, provider errors, and binary or streaming limits.                                             |

When a provider does not fit a leaf, implement the canonical TypeScript interface directly and keep
the other leaves that still fit. Bypassing a leaf also means owning its guarantees for that concern;
do not call around a stateful module while relying on its journal, fence, or lifetime elsewhere.

## Start here

- For an OAuth-shaped provider, start with [Connect flows](USAGE.md#connect-flows), then read the
  [credentials guide](USAGE.md#credentials). They cover browser handoff sequencing, account-side
  storage, consumer-side RPC, refresh, replay, expiry, and action fences.
- For provider writes, use [`./actions`](#module-inventory) and read
  [Actions and files](USAGE.md#actions-and-files).
- For every gatekeeper's observer methods, select a strategy from `./observers` and read
  [Observations](USAGE.md#observations).
- For details attached to one class, function, option, or error, read that export's JSDoc.

Import from the narrow subpath:

```ts
import { CredentialCoordinator, CredentialSource } from "@gadgets/gatekeeper-kit/credentials";
```

## Module inventory

| Subpath               | Purpose                                                                    | Use it when                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./connect-nonce`     | Nonce generation, expiry, and constant-time comparison.                    | A connect flow mints or checks its own nonce. The handshake and credential modules already use it. |
| `./connect-handshake` | Two-stage `initiation` to `oauth` nonce storage.                           | A connect link or form redirects through an OAuth provider.                                        |
| `./credential-stage`  | Durable reconnect escrow, exact commit, and exact-stage cleanup.           | A reconnect must remain inert until Workshop commits the completed stage.                          |
| `./connect-pages`     | Hardened connect HTML, escaping, and browser mutation guards.              | A gatekeeper serves HTML from its own origin.                                                      |
| `./credentials`       | Account-side `CredentialCoordinator` and consumer-side `CredentialSource`. | An OAuth-shaped provider stores, refreshes, or rejects credentials.                                |
| `./credential-expiry` | Durable, deduplicated `credentialsExpired()` notification.                 | An account has a Workshop connect callback to notify.                                              |
| `./auth-retry`        | One refresh and replay without account adjudication.                       | A token flow has no `CredentialSource`; otherwise use `CredentialSource.run()`.                    |
| `./cache`             | Authority-partitioned Durable Object TTL caching.                          | Provider reads repeat and reconnects must fence stale fills.                                       |
| `./cursors`           | Array, page-number, offset, and continuation-token cursors.                | A session returns more rows than one RPC reply should carry.                                       |
| `./actions`           | Action declaration, approval, application, retention, and journaling.      | An operation has an externally visible side effect.                                                |
| `./action-files`      | Bounded, integrity-checked action-file storage.                            | A queued action carries file bytes. Store only its `ActionFileReference` in the action.            |
| `./simulation`        | Pending-action replay and provisional-ID mapping.                          | An action continues with simulation and later reads must include its projected effect.             |
| `./observers`         | Observer admission strategies and per-read authorization.                  | A gatekeeper implements its required observer methods.                                             |
| `./preview-oauth`     | Signed OAuth state and stable-to-preview callback relay.                   | Preview Workers share one callback registered with the OAuth provider.                             |
| `./endpoint`          | User-supplied provider endpoint normalization.                             | A user enters a self-hosted provider URL.                                                          |
| `./http-errors`       | HTTP access-error classification and ACL probes.                           | A verifier distinguishes no access from provider failure.                                          |
| `./response-body`     | Strict byte-capped response decoding.                                      | A gatekeeper reads any provider response body.                                                     |

## Internal modules

The package does not export `kv`, `positive-int`, `per-storage`, `serial-queue`, `single-flight`,
`action-journal`, or `observer-tracker`. The last two are re-exported through `./actions` and
`./observers`.
