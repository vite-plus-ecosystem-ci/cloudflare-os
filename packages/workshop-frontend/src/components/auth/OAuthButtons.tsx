/**
 * Renders a sign-in button per auth-capable gatekeeper vendor. Clicking starts a login attempt and
 * opens the gatekeeper's OAuth URL as a disowned popup carrying the attempt's nonce in its own
 * sessionStorage (see connectHandoff.ts). When the flow finishes, the gatekeeper's final page lands
 * the popup on our /connect/handoff page, which confirms the single-use ticket together with the
 * nonce over the public API. That confirmation is what ties the session to this browser: the
 * sign-in URL alone can be finished by anyone. This component meanwhile polls
 * `attempt.receive()`, which releases the session token only once the ticket is confirmed and only
 * to the holder of the `attempt` capability; the popup never sees the token. On success the token
 * is stored and the app re-authenticates.
 *
 * A newer attempt waits for the previous one's in-flight `receive()` before tearing it down: the
 * server releases the token exactly once, so a call cancelled mid-flight could discard a token
 * that had already been handed out, leaving the user to sign in twice.
