/**
 * The page a finished connect / sign-in popup lands on (HANDOFF_PATH), with the single-use ticket
 * in the URL fragment. It redeems the ticket together with the flow's nonce, which only this popup
 * holds: sessionStorage is per top-level browsing context and per origin, so what the Workshop tab
 * wrote into this popup before navigating it (`openDisownedPopup`) is readable again here, after
 * the trip through the gatekeeper and the provider, and nowhere else. A handoff link opened any
 * other way carries no nonce and is reported invalid without a call to the server.
 *
 * A connect is redeemed over this popup's own authenticated session (`completeConnectHandoff`),
 * established like any Workshop tab's (the shared 'authToken', or the Cloudflare Access identity
 * in an Access deployment); the account then reaches the tab that started the flow through
 * `subscribeConnectedAccounts()`. A sign-in popup has no session:
 * it confirms the ticket over the public API (`confirmLogin`), and the login tab collects the token
 * from its own `LoginAttempt`. The page therefore runs standalone, outside the app shell and
 * without waiting on the root's auth, with its own `useAuth` for the connect case.
 *
 * The fragment is stripped once read, and the storage record is spent as it is read, so neither a
 * reload nor a re-render can present the ticket twice. The one repeat is deliberate: a redemption
 * that failed is presented again over the next session, when the RPC connection has been replaced
 * after an outage (`main.tsx` swaps the stub once per reconnect, and `useAuth` re-authenticates on
 * it). That is safe because ticket and nonce are single-use server-side: if the first call did
 * reach the server, the repeat is refused as expired and changes nothing; if it died with the
 * socket, the repeat is the first the server hears of it. This page is the only surface a rejected
 * ticket is reported on, so the server's message is shown verbatim.
