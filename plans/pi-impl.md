# Migrating from the Vercel AI SDK to pi-ai + pi-agent-core: implementation playbook

*Companion to `plans/pi.md` (feasibility). This is a direct implementation guide for a coding
agent: all design decisions are made; implement the whole thing in one pass. The project is in
early alpha — minor behavioral regressions are acceptable and will be fixed as discovered. Do
not build parallel/intermediate implementations, compatibility shims for the old path, or
elaborate test harnesses.*

**Reference materials:** `@earendil-works/pi-ai` and `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`
(0.83.0, exact-pinned) are already installed in `packages/workshop-backend`. The installed
packages are the API reference: complete `.d.ts` declarations for signatures, plus
unbundled, unminified per-module dist JS (doc comments preserved) for behavior — read
`node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/**` and
`node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-agent-core/dist/**` directly. (Source maps embed
`sourcesContent` if the original TypeScript is ever needed.) The appendix (§9) summarizes
what was verified at plan-writing time; the installed source is authoritative.

## 1. Fixed decisions

These are settled; do not re-litigate during implementation.

1. **Scope:** Phase 1 only — full replacement of the AI SDK layer, chat log format and
   frontend untouched. Phase 2 items (steering, immediate cost display, custom message
   types, PDF bridge) are follow-ups (§8).
2. **Loop:** pi-agent-core's low-level `runAgentLoopContinue` (awaited event sink), not the
   stateful `Agent` class. `toolExecution: "sequential"`. `convertToLlm` = identity.
   No steering/follow-up queues. Turn cap 30 via `shouldStopAfterTurn`.
3. **Anthropic caching:** pi's automatic behavior, default `cacheRetention` (`"short"`).
   No custom breakpoint logic of any kind; delete today's `prepareStep` strategy. Assume
   pi does it right.
4. **System prompt:** the two slots concatenate into pi's single `Context.systemPrompt`
   string, static slot first (preserves prefix stability). Keep the two-part construction
   in code.
5. **Errors:** pi never throws for provider failures; `runAgent` converts an
   error/aborted-stop into a thrown error for the overseer (§4.5). Match today's behavior
   in spirit, not in detail — do the most reasonable thing. Partial content from a failed
   turn is not persisted. If the abort signal fired, rethrow the abort so cancellation
   looks like today.
6. **Attachments:** first commit supports text + image only, for every provider
   (pi has no file/document part). Replayed history containing other attachment types
   degrades to a text marker instead of failing (§4.4). PDF bridge is a follow-up (§8).
7. **Cloudflare routing:** pi is verified fetch-only (no Workers-binding support), so all
   inference moves to HTTPS with tokens — including same-account AI Gateway and Workers AI,
   which today use the `WORKERS_AI` binding (§4.2). Structure the code so a binding-backed
   path can return later via pi's injected `fetch` (upstream ask filed; see §8). The
   `WORKERS_AI` binding itself **stays** — it's still used by webFetch's
   document-to-Markdown conversion, and by the binding arm of `getAiGatewayLogCost`
   (which becomes normally-unreachable under pi but is kept for the binding's return).
   Cost fetching itself is already dual-route since the `AiGatewayLogRoute` change:
   `getAiGatewayLogCost` in ai-gateway.ts supports the REST API with a Bearer token —
   under pi, all produced log routes are the token variant, so cost accounting keeps
   working (including for BYOK).
8. **OpenAI** uses pi's `openai-responses` API (matches today's Responses-API +
   `store: false` + encrypted-reasoning behavior — preserve statelessness; see §9 compat
   flags). **Ollama** uses `openai-completions` against the server's OpenAI-compat
   endpoint: interpret `AiModelConfig.apiUrl` as the Ollama server base and append `/v1`.
9. **Model metadata:** `SUGGESTED_MODELS` (workshop-shared) remains authoritative for
   `contextWindow`/`outputLimit` (compaction budgets must not change). pi's generated
   catalog may be consulted for cost/compat of known models; unknown models get a
   synthesized `Model` with zero cost.
10. **BYOK unified billing:** the user's default gateway `/compat` endpoint with compound
    `{provider}/{model}` ids over `openai-completions` — functionally what
    `createUnified()` does today.
11. **Testing:** `pnpm build` + `pnpm lint` + `pnpm test` must pass; verification beyond
    that is a manual smoke checklist (§7). No parity harness, no new automated test
    suites. However, `workshop-backend/__tests__/` now has real unit tests:
    `ai-models.test.ts` mocks `ai-gateway-provider`/`workers-ai-provider` (packages this
    migration deletes) and must be **rewritten against the pi implementation**, preserving
    the behavioral contract it encodes (routing precedence incl. BYOK-over-platform,
    metadata content, log-route selection, `CF_AI_GATEWAY_WAI`/`WAI_DIRECT` conflict
    rules). Tip: with pi, no module mocks are needed — assert on the returned handle's
    `model` (baseUrl/id/api) and drive `handle.stream` with an injected `options.fetch`
    stub to assert URLs/headers. `ai-gateway.test.ts` / `ai-gateway-cost.test.ts` /
    `web-fetch.test.ts` test AI-SDK-free code and should pass unchanged or nearly so.
12. **`nodejs_compat`:** pre-authorized — if pi or the SDKs it wraps need it, add
    `nodejs_compat` to both `wrangler.jsonc` and `wrangler.dev.jsonc` (replacing
    `nodejs_als`, which it subsumes).
13. **Keep `streaming-json-parser.ts`.** pi's `toolcall_delta` provides the same raw JSON
    fragments the parser already consumes; pi's own partial-JSON helper reparses from
    scratch per delta (O(n²) on big file writes). Preview managers stay as-is.
14. **One commit** (or one small stack if `git add -p` hygiene demands), plus the follow-up
    commits in §8. No requirement that intermediate states build.

## 2. Invariants — do not change

- `AiChatMessage` / `AiToolCall` / `AiChatStreamEvent` and everything else in
  `workshop-shared/src/api.ts` (except nothing — this package should have **zero diff**).
- The Overseer turn lifecycle: `startAgent`, `#runAgentTurnWithContext`'s loop/nudge/
  callback logic, `activeAgents` resume, compaction commit/rollback, `awaitDecision`
  suspension. Only its error-classification `catch` and the `getModel` call change.
- Replay **logic** in `runAgent`: merge/revert status pass, version locks,
  `pendingReplayEdits`, crashed-turn re-adoption (creations/binding additions), binding
  accumulation, `PARAMS_n` allocation, revert elision, `changeIdMap`. Only the *shapes
  pushed into the model context* change.
- Compaction policy (`agent-compaction.ts` boundary/checkpoint logic) — only projection
  types and the summarization call change.
- `CodePreviewManager`, `ExecuteCodeStreamManager`, `streaming-json-parser.ts`.
- Frontend: zero changes.

## 3. Dependencies and configuration

`packages/workshop-backend/package.json`:

- Remove: `ai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/google`, `@ai-sdk/openai`,
  `ai-gateway-provider`, `workers-ai-provider`, `ollama-ai-provider-v2`, and `zod`
  (verify zod has no remaining uses after the tool rewrite).
- Already added (exact pins, 0.83.0): `@earendil-works/pi-ai`,
  `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`. (Note: pnpm reported ignored build scripts for
  `@google/genai`/`protobufjs` — expected; do not `pnpm approve-builds` unless something
  actually breaks at runtime.)
- Import only from: `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (core), specific
  `@earendil-works/pi-ai/providers/*` modules if used, `@earendil-works/pi-ai/api/*`
  modules, and `@earendil-works/pi-agent-core`. Never `providers/all` (~30 providers in
  the bundle), never `/compat` (side effects), never `pi-agent-core/node`.

Environment variables. The recent AI Gateway auth-token work (see `AiGatewayConfig`,
env.d.ts) already established `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID` / `CF_AI_GATEWAY_API_TOKEN`
(a Run + Read token — it also drives cost-log reads), enforced as a pair, and added
`CF_AI_GATEWAY_WAI_DIRECT` (mutually exclusive with `CF_AI_GATEWAY_WAI`). The pi migration
tightens this (update env.d.ts comments, README/docs, and
`run-dev-server.js`/`generate-wrangler-prod.js` if they template these):

- `CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID` + `CF_AI_GATEWAY_API_TOKEN` become **required** whenever
  `CF_AI_GATEWAY` is set — the token-less same-account mode existed only because of the
  Workers binding, which pi can't use. Make `AiGatewayConfig`'s constructor throw (or
  `getAiGatewayConfig` return null with a loud log) when they're absent.
- `CF_AI_GATEWAY_WAI` / `CF_AI_GATEWAY_WAI_DIRECT` keep their merged semantics, mapped to
  pi endpoints: `workersAiGateway` set → Workers AI through the gateway's `/compat`
  endpoint (compound `workers-ai/{model}` id; log route + gateway metadata apply);
  `WAI_DIRECT` (i.e. `workersAiGateway === undefined`) → the plain Workers AI REST
  endpoint `api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{acct}/ai/v1` — no gateway, no log
  route, no gateway metadata (mirroring the merged behavior where the direct-binding path
  returns a model with no `aiGatewayLogRoute`). The direct path reuses the
  `CF_AI_GATEWAY_*` account/token pair.
- Direct Workers AI with **no** gateway mode at all (provider `"cloudflare"` outside
  gateway mode): needs REST credentials — new `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` /
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` env vars, falling back to the `CF_AI_GATEWAY_*` pair. If neither
  is available, `getModel` throws a clear "Workers AI now requires API credentials" error.

Bundling check: after `pnpm install`, confirm the worker bundles without pulling pi's
Bedrock module (its Node-only deps sit behind a variable-specifier dynamic import that
bundlers can't follow — expect at most a warning). If esbuild chokes on the dynamic import,
mark it external or alias it out.

## 4. Implementation guide

(`file.ts:NNN` references are approximate — the AI Gateway auth-token change shifted some
line numbers; locate by symbol name.)

### 4.1 `ai-invoke.ts` (new, small)

pi streams never reject; adapt to throwing callers once:

```ts
export type ModelHandle = { /* §4.2 */ };
export async function completeText(handle: ModelHandle, args: {
  systemPrompt?: string;
  prompt?: string;               // convenience: wraps into a single user message
  messages?: Message[];
  maxTokens?: number;
  signal?: AbortSignal;
}): Promise<string>;
```

Implementation: `handle.stream(handle.model, context, options).result()`; if
`stopReason` is `"error"`/`"aborted"`, throw (include `errorMessage`); else return
concatenated text content. Used by title generation, binding naming, compaction summary,
and `LanguageModelBindingImpl.run`.

### 4.2 `ai-models.ts` — rewritten

Replace the AI SDK provider stack with pi. Export:

The current code (after the AI Gateway auth-token change) exposes
`getModel(env, config, initiator, options: ModelRoutingOptions)` and
`getModelWithLogRoute(...)` returning `{model, aiGatewayLogRoute?}`, where
`ModelRoutingOptions = {sessionAffinity?, userGateway?, metadata?: GatewayMetadataContext}`.
Keep that outer shape; the handle absorbs the log route:

```ts
export type ModelHandle = {
  model: Model<Api>;     // pi model descriptor
  stream: StreamFn;      // (model, context, options) => AssistantMessageEventStream
                         // closes over routing/auth; merges per-API options; never throws
  aiGatewayLogRoute?: AiGatewayLogRoute;  // for cost accounting; replaces
                                          // getModelWithLogRoute's second return + the
                                          // aiGatewayLogRoute parameter of runAgent
  // plus whatever mechanism surfaces the last response's cf-aig-log-id and HTTP status
};
export function getModel(env, config: AiModelConfig, initiator: AiChatAuthorInfo,
                         options: ModelRoutingOptions = {}): ModelHandle;
```

Keep `buildMetadata` / `GatewayMetadataContext` / the structured `GatewayMetadata`
attribution schema exactly as they are — every call site already passes a context
(`chat` / `thread-title` / `gadget-title` / `model-binding`).

Key implementation facts (verified; see §9):

- **Don't use pi's `Models` collection or credential store.** Build `Model` objects
  ourselves and call the API implementations (or a locally constructed
  `createProvider({... api: {...}})`) directly, passing auth per call via `options.apiKey`
  / `options.headers` / `options.env`. pi dispatches `provider.stream()` on `model.api`
  with no catalog-membership check, so caller-constructed models are fully supported.
- **Model synthesis:** map our provider → pi api:
  `anthropic → "anthropic-messages"`, `openai → "openai-responses"`,
  `google → "google-generative-ai"`, `cloudflare → "openai-completions"`,
  `ollama → "openai-completions"`. Fill `contextWindow`/`maxTokens` from
  `getModelTokenLimits`-compatible data (`SUGGESTED_MODELS`), `cost` from pi's builtin
  catalog entry when the model id is known (import per-provider, not `providers/all`),
  else zeros. Set compat flags: Anthropic models get adaptive thinking (see below);
  OpenAI keeps stateless ZDR behavior (`store: false` semantics — check how
  `openai-responses` handles `supportsStore`/store in `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/api/openai-responses.js`
  and set whatever keeps requests stateless with encrypted reasoning); Workers AI models
  get `sendSessionAffinityHeaders: true` and honor `WORKERS_AI_OUTPUT_LIMIT`.
- **Routing modes** (same three as today, § markers refer to current code):
  - *Direct* (`getModelDirect`): baseUrl = provider default or `config.apiUrl`;
    `apiKey = config.apiToken`. Ollama: baseUrl = `config.apiUrl` + `/v1`, bearer header
    only when `apiToken` non-empty (as today).
  - *Platform AI Gateway* (`getModelViaGateway`): baseUrl per upstream —
    `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{accountId}/{gateway}/anthropic` (api
    anthropic-messages), `.../openai` (openai-responses), `.../google-ai-studio`
    (google-generative-ai; pi's own gateway catalog skips google but the passthrough path +
    google API impl works — construct it ourselves), and Workers AI per the
    `workersAiGateway` / `WAI_DIRECT` mapping in §3 (gateway `/compat` with compound
    `workers-ai/{model}` id, or the direct REST endpoint). Auth: headers
    `{"cf-aig-authorization": "Bearer <token>", Authorization: null, "x-api-key": null}` —
    pi's API impls explicitly recognize `cf-aig-authorization` and skip SDK auth
    (`getClientApiKey` returns a dummy); the direct Workers AI REST endpoint uses plain
    `Authorization: Bearer` (pi's `apiKey`). Metadata: pi does **not** forward
    `options.metadata` as `cf-aig-metadata`; set the `cf-aig-metadata` header ourselves —
    JSON of `buildMetadata(initiator, context)` (the structured schema), on gateway-routed
    requests only. `aiGatewayLogRoute`: always the token variant
    `{gateway, accountId, apiToken}` (the binding variant is never produced under pi);
    none for the direct-REST Workers AI path.
  - *BYOK* (`getModelViaUserGateway`): baseUrl
    `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{userAccountId}/default/compat`, compound
    `{UNIFIED_BILLING_PROVIDER_PATH[provider]}/{model}` id, openai-completions api,
    `cf-aig-authorization: Bearer <user token>`, same metadata header;
    `aiGatewayLogRoute = {gateway: "default", accountId, apiToken}` as in the current
    code.
- **`handle.stream`** merges per-call options before delegating: `signal`, `maxTokens`,
  session affinity (`sessionId: sessionAffinity` — pi only sends it when caching isn't
  `"none"`, which is fine), `onResponse` to capture `cf-aig-log-id` from response headers
  (stash it on the handle or via callback for the persister), and per-API extras:
  Anthropic adaptive thinking (check `node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/api/anthropic-messages.js` for
  the current adaptive mechanism — an `AnthropicOptions` field and/or
  `compat.forceAdaptiveThinking`; enable it, matching today's
  `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`). Other providers keep default reasoning behavior.
- **Binding-shim future:** leave a clearly marked seam — the place where a custom
  `fetch` would be injected into options (pi passes `options.fetch` into the SDK clients on
  all paths) — with a comment referencing the upstream ask, so binding support can return
  without restructuring. Don't implement the shim.
- `captureAiGatewayLogId` middleware and all `ai-gateway-provider`/`workers-ai-provider`
  imports are deleted. `LanguageModelGatekeeper` / `LanguageModelBindingImpl` stay,
  switching to `completeText`.

`ai-gateway.ts`: config class gains the required-credentials rule from §3; unchanged
otherwise.

### 4.3 `agent.ts` — the core rewrite

**Imports:** drop everything from `"ai"` and `"zod"`; add pi-ai types (`Message`,
`UserMessage`, `AssistantMessage`, `ToolResultMessage`, `ToolCall`, content types,
`AssistantMessageEvent`), TypeBox (`Type`, re-exported from pi-ai), and pi-agent-core
(`runAgentLoopContinue`, `AgentContext`, `AgentLoopConfig`, `AgentTool`,
`AgentToolResult`, `AgentEvent`).

**Replay (agent.ts:1159–1844):** keep all logic; change pushed shapes:

| Today | pi |
|---|---|
| two `{role:"system"}` slots | none in the array — build `Context.systemPrompt` from the two strings at the end (keep `modelMessageSources`' slot entries or drop them; adjust compaction projection accordingly) |
| `{role:"user", content}` | `{role:"user", content, timestamp}` (`UserMessage`; timestamp from the chat record) |
| user parts array (text/image/file) | `(TextContent \| ImageContent)[]`; images become `{type:"image", data: base64, mimeType}` (pi wants base64 strings — encode); text-like attachments stay inlined text as today; **any other type → text marker** `[Attached file <name> (<mime>) omitted — this file type is no longer supported]` |
| `{role:"assistant", content}` + `ToolCallPart`s | `AssistantMessage` with `content: [{type:"text",text}, ...{type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}]` — use a helper `makeReplayAssistantMessage(content, timestamp)` filling required bookkeeping fields (`api`/`provider`/`model` from the handle, zero `usage`, `stopReason:"stop"`) |
| `{role:"tool", content:[tool-result]}` | `ToolResultMessage {role:"toolResult", toolCallId, toolName, content:[{type:"text",text}], isError, timestamp}` |
| output `{type:"text"\|"json", value}` | text content; JSON via `JSON.stringify(value)` — define one helper used by replay so live results (§ tools below) and replayed results produce identical text |
| output `{type:"error-text"}` | text content + `isError: true` |
| checkpoint summary user message | same, as `UserMessage` |

The empty-message skip (Anthropic rejects empties, agent.ts:1294) stays.

**System prompt assembly (agent.ts:1949–2043):** unchanged content; the two strings are
joined `slot0 + "\n\n" + slot1` into `systemPrompt` instead of occupying array slots.

**Tools (agent.ts:2137–2648):** each `tool()` becomes an `AgentTool`:

- `parameters`: TypeBox `Type.Object({...})` with the exact same descriptions
  (`Type.Optional(Type.String({description}))` etc.). Drop `outputSchema` (advisory only;
  its useful text is already in descriptions).
- `label`: short human string (new required field; pick sensible ones).
- `execute(toolCallId, params, signal)`: same bodies. Return
  `{content: [{type:"text", text}], details}` where `text` is exactly what the model
  should see (for JSON results, the same helper as replay) and `details` replaces
  `toolCallNotes` — carry `observedCodeVersion`, recorded `output`
  (webFetch/setGadgetBinding/createGadget/listBlueprints/etc.), and on failure set
  `details` via the existing try/catch pattern *before* rethrowing. Since a thrown error
  loses `details` in pi's conversion, keep notes for the error path in a local
  `toolCallNotes`-like map (only for errors; success data rides `details`). Alternatively
  return an explicit error result — but pi marks `isError` only for thrown errors, so
  keep throw + side map for errors. Choose one approach and apply it uniformly.
- `executeCode` keeps streaming output through `emitStreamEvent({type:"toolOutputDelta"...})`
  directly (don't route through pi's `onUpdate`).
- `giveUp` conditional tool and the spawner-restricted subset: same construction, now as
  arrays/objects of `AgentTool`.

**The loop (replacing agent.ts:2722–2882):**

```ts
let context: AgentContext = { systemPrompt, messages, tools };
let turnCount = 0;
let newMessages = await runAgentLoopContinue(context, {
  model: handle.model,
  convertToLlm: (msgs) => msgs as Message[],
  toolExecution: "sequential",
  maxTokens: maxOutputTokens,
  shouldStopAfterTurn: () =>
      ++turnCount >= 30 || connectionRequested || awaitingActionDecision ||
      (callbackInitiated && hooks.activeAgentCallbackCount(chatId) === 0),
}, emit, abortSignal, handle.stream);
```

(Exact signature/order per pi source — verify. If `runAgentLoopContinue` rejects our
context shape — it requires the last message to be user/toolResult, which replay
guarantees — fall back to `agentLoop` with the tail split out.)

`emit` (the awaited `AgentEventSink`) handles:

- `message_update` → client stream fan-out (below).
- `turn_end {message, toolResults}` → **the persistence barrier**, replacing
  `onStepFinish`:
  - If `message.stopReason` is `"error"` or `"aborted"`: record it (for the throw after
    the loop) and persist nothing.
  - Else build the `AiChatMessageBody`: `message` = concatenated text blocks;
    `reasoning` = concatenated thinking blocks (skip `redacted`); `toolCalls` = toolCall
    blocks mapped to `AiToolCall{toolCallId, toolName, input: arguments}` merged with the
    matching tool result's `details` and error info (`isError` → `error` from the result
    text or the error side map).
  - Run `consumeCapturedActions` (latching `awaitingActionDecision`) and
    `consumeCapturedConnectionRequests` exactly as today (agent.ts:2846–2863).
  - `hooks.addChatMessages(chatId, author, msgs, usage.totalTokens,
    capturedAiGatewayLogId, handle.aiGatewayLogRoute)` — the hook already takes the route
    (see `AgentHooks.addChatMessages`); the log id comes from the handle's `onResponse`
    capture instead of `response.headers`.
  - Reset per-step streaming state (`executeCodeStreamManager.clear()` etc.).
- `tool_execution_end` → emit `toolCallFinished` for executeCode (which today defers
  completion until execution ends).

After the loop: `flushCapturedYdocChanges()` in a `finally` (unchanged); if an
error/aborted stop was recorded, throw — `abortSignal.throwIfAborted()` first so
cancellation surfaces as an abort, then `throw new AgentTurnError(errorMessage,
lastResponseStatus)` (§4.5).

**Client stream fan-out** (replacing the `onChunk` switch, agent.ts:2745–2794), driven by
`message_update.assistantMessageEvent`:

| pi event | action |
|---|---|
| `text_delta` | `emitStreamEvent({type:"textDelta", delta})` |
| `thinking_delta` | `reasoningDelta` |
| `toolcall_start` | read id/name from `partial.content[contentIndex]`; emit `toolCallStarted`; `codePreviewManager.startToolCall`; `executeCodeStreamManager.startToolCall`; `clearActiveFile` for non-file tools (as today) |
| `toolcall_delta` | `appendInput(id, delta)` on both managers (raw JSON fragment — same feed as today) |
| `toolcall_end` | `finishToolCall`; emit `toolCallFinished` — except executeCode, which waits for `tool_execution_end` (as today) |

This replaces the old "mark previous tool finished when the next starts" workaround; if
Workers AI via pi turns out to delay `toolcall_end` events, live with it (alpha) and note
it.

**Compaction call** (agent.ts:2086–2092): `generateText` → `completeText(handle,
{systemPrompt: COMPACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT, messages: summaryMessages, maxTokens, signal})`.

**Signature change:** `runAgent(hooks, chosenModel: LanguageModel, ...,
aiGatewayLogRoute?)` → `runAgent(hooks, handle: ModelHandle, ...)` — the recently added
trailing `aiGatewayLogRoute` parameter is absorbed into the handle
(`AgentHooks.addChatMessages` keeps its route parameter). The old
`chosenModel.provider.startsWith("anthropic")` check and the whole `prepareStep` block
(agent.ts:2660–2720) are deleted.

### 4.4 `agent-compaction.ts` — types only

- `CompactionProjectionMessage.message: ModelMessage` → pi `Message`.
- `flattenModelMessage` / `projectionMessageWeight` / `buildSummaryPrompt`: adapt to pi
  content blocks (`toolCall` blocks on assistant messages; `toolResult` messages;
  `thinking` vs `reasoning`; image parts → marker). Same merge/estimate logic; no
  recalibration of the char-weight heuristics.
- `getModelTokenLimits` unchanged.

### 4.5 `overseer.ts`

- Replace `import { generateText, RetryError, APICallError } from "ai"` (line 11).
- Define `AgentTurnError` (in agent.ts or ai-invoke.ts):
  `{ message: string; statusCode?: number }`. `statusCode` comes from the last
  `onResponse` seen by the handle for the failing request, when available.
- The catch in `#runAgentTurnWithContext` (overseer.ts:3741–3789): replace the
  `APICallError`/`RetryError` extraction with `err instanceof AgentTurnError`; keep the
  triage policy (reportIssue unless a known status < 500) and keep
  `postAgentErrorMessage` with the error text. Don't chase exact message-format parity.
- The `getModelWithLogRoute` call site in `#runAgentTurnWithContext` becomes a single
  `getModel(...)` returning a `ModelHandle` (same `ModelRoutingOptions` including the
  `{source: "chat", gadgetId, chatId}` metadata context) passed to `runAgent`; the
  destructured `aiGatewayLogRoute` local and the extra `runAgent` argument go away.
- One-shot call sites → `completeText`, each keeping its existing metadata context in the
  `getModel` options: `generateBindingName` (10s timeout via `signal`),
  `generateThreadTitle` (`thread-title`), `generateGadgetTitle` (`gadget-title`);
  `LanguageModelGatekeeper.startSession` keeps passing `ctx.props.metadata`
  (`model-binding`).
- Cost accounting is untouched: `#getCostFromAiGateway`'s retry loop and
  `getAiGatewayLogCost` (both route arms — keep the binding arm even though pi-produced
  routes are always the token variant; it's tested and supports the future binding
  re-enable), `addChatMessages`, compaction plumbing all stay as they are.

### 4.6 `chat-attachment-validation.ts`

Narrow `ATTACHMENT_SUPPORT_BY_PROVIDER` to `isTextOrImageMime` for **all** providers;
update the comments to explain pi-ai currently encodes only text and image content parts
(and reference the follow-up plan for PDFs). Upload validation thus rejects PDFs at the
door; replay degradation (§4.3) covers pre-existing logs.

### 4.7 Cleanup sweep

- Remove now-unused imports/files; `pnpm lint` treats unused imports as errors.
- `pnpm build` (tsc across packages) must pass; `packages/workshop-shared` and the
  frontend must have zero diff.
- Confirm the bundle excludes Bedrock/Node-only modules (§3).

## 5. What "reasonable" means for the judgment calls

Guidance for spots where behavior can't match exactly:

- Error message text shown to users: include pi's `errorMessage`; don't reconstruct the
  AI SDK's `summary — responseBody` format.
- Retry behavior: accept pi's defaults (`maxRetries` etc.) unless something is obviously
  pathological.
- Usage accounting: keep passing `usage.totalTokens` to `addChatMessages` (it feeds
  compaction's `measuredTokens`); pi's `Usage.totalTokens` is the analogue. Cost stays on
  the async gateway-log path for now.
- Reasoning persistence: concatenate thinking blocks into `msg.reasoning` as today;
  redacted blocks skipped. Cross-turn thinking is not replayed (same as today).
- If pi's event/callback ordering differs subtly from this plan's description, trust the
  pi source and preserve our latching semantics (latch in tool execute / `turn_end`, read
  in `shouldStopAfterTurn`).

## 6. Things that look tempting but are out of scope

- Steering/follow-up queues, immediate cost display, custom `CustomAgentMessages` types,
  catalog-driven `SUGGESTED_MODELS`, deleting `streaming-json-parser.ts`, the PDF bridge,
  the fetch-to-binding shim, any Anthropic cache tuning, any refactor of `AgentHooks`.

## 7. Verification

1. `pnpm build && pnpm lint && pnpm test` clean — including the rewritten
   `__tests__/ai-models.test.ts` (see decision 11) and the untouched
   `ai-gateway`/`ai-gateway-cost`/`web-fetch` suites.
2. Manual smoke, dev server, at least one Anthropic model plus one other provider:
   - fresh chat: create gadget from blueprint, edit files, watch live diff preview +
     executeCode code/output streaming;
   - readFile/editFile round trip; merge; revert; confirm the agent acknowledges the
     revert (synthetic observation) on the next turn;
   - executeCode with an agent callback (`self.foo()`), resolve it; nudge loop sanity;
   - requestConnection flow: request ends the turn; accept resumes;
   - abort mid-stream (cancel button); restart dev server mid-turn and confirm resume;
   - `/compact`, then continue the conversation across the checkpoint;
   - a chat from an existing dev database (pre-migration log) replays without errors.
3. Confirm cache hits happen at all for Anthropic (usage `cacheRead > 0` on a second
   turn) — a sanity check, not a tuning exercise.

## 8. Follow-up work (separate commits/PRs, after Phase 1 lands)

1. **PDF bridge:** re-enable PDF uploads for Anthropic/OpenAI by injecting provider
   `document`/`input_file` blocks via `onPayload` (payload replacement is supported), with
   replay markers upgraded back to real parts. In parallel: upstream ask for a first-class
   document content type; drop the bridge when it lands.
2. **Binding-backed Cloudflare transport:** upstream ask for Workers-binding support (or
   ship our own fetch-to-binding shim through `options.fetch` at the seam left in
   ai-models.ts), then relax the token requirements from §3.
3. **Upstream asks to file now:** workerd in pi's CI support matrix; document content
   parts; binding transport; `cf-aig-metadata` forwarding from `options.metadata`;
   (nice-to-have) runtime-agnostic compaction helpers.
4. **Phase 2 dividends** (from the feasibility report): steering/follow-up UI; immediate
   per-message cost display from `usage.cost`; custom message types for synthetic replay
   entries; catalog consolidation.

## 9. Appendix: verified pi API reference (0.83.x)

Verified against the pi source; re-verify signatures in `pi/` before relying on them.

**pi-ai core types** (`node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/types.d.ts`):

- `Context {systemPrompt?: string; messages: Message[]; tools?: Tool[]}`.
- `Message = UserMessage | AssistantMessage | ToolResultMessage`.
- `UserMessage {role:"user", content: string | (TextContent|ImageContent)[], timestamp}`.
- `AssistantMessage {role:"assistant", content: (TextContent|ThinkingContent|ToolCall)[],
  api, provider, model, usage: Usage, stopReason: StopReason, errorMessage?, timestamp, ...}`.
- `ToolResultMessage {role:"toolResult", toolCallId, toolName,
  content:(TextContent|ImageContent)[], details?, isError, timestamp}`.
- `TextContent {type:"text", text}`; `ThinkingContent {type:"thinking", thinking, redacted?}`;
  `ImageContent {type:"image", data /*base64*/, mimeType}`;
  `ToolCall {type:"toolCall", id, name, arguments}`.
- `Usage {input, output, cacheRead, cacheWrite, totalTokens, cost:{...,total}}`.
- `StopReason = "pending"|"stop"|"length"|"toolUse"|"error"|"aborted"`; errors/aborts are
  events + final messages, never thrown/rejected.
- `Tool {name, description, parameters: TSchema}` (TypeBox; `Type`, `Static` re-exported).
- `StreamOptions {temperature?, maxTokens?, signal?, apiKey?, fetch?, headers?
  (null value suppresses a default header), env? (placeholder substitution, e.g.
  CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID), sessionId?, cacheRetention? ("none"|"short"|"long", default
  short), onPayload? (may return replacement payload), onResponse? ({status, headers},
  model), maxRetries?, metadata?, timeoutMs?}`; `SimpleStreamOptions` adds
  `reasoning?: "minimal"|...|"max"`.
- Streaming events: `start`, `text_start/delta/end`, `thinking_start/delta/end`,
  `toolcall_start/delta/end` (delta = raw JSON fragment; `partial: AssistantMessage` on
  every event), `done {reason, message}`, `error {reason, error: AssistantMessage}`.
  Streams: `for await` + `.result(): Promise<AssistantMessage>`.
- `Model<TApi> {id, name, api, provider, baseUrl, reasoning, input, cost, contextWindow,
  maxTokens, compat?}` — plain data; caller-constructed models work; api dispatch only.

**Cloudflare specifics** (`node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/providers/cloudflare-*.js`, `api/cloudflare.js`):

- Pure HTTPS; zero binding awareness; `options.fetch` honored on all paths (passed into
  the wrapped official SDK clients).
- baseUrl placeholders `{CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID}`/`{CLOUDFLARE_GATEWAY_ID}` substituted from
  `options.env` by the `cloudflareStreams` wrapper; endpoints:
  Workers AI REST `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{acct}/ai/v1`
  (openai-completions, `Authorization: Bearer`);
  gateway passthroughs `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{acct}/{gw}/anthropic|openai`
  (native ids) and unified `/compat` (openai-completions, compound `provider/model` ids).
- Gateway auth: `cf-aig-authorization: Bearer <token>` header with
  `Authorization: null, "x-api-key": null` suppressions; API impls recognize this and use a
  dummy SDK key. `options.metadata` is **not** sent as `cf-aig-metadata` (only Anthropic
  body `metadata.user_id`).
- Session affinity: gated on `options.sessionId` + `compat.sendSessionAffinityHeaders`.

**Anthropic caching** (`node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-ai/dist/api/anthropic-messages.js`): automatic
breakpoints on the system prompt block, last immediate tool definition, and the last block
of the final user-role message (includes tool_result); recomputed per request;
`cacheRetention: "short"` → ephemeral 5m. Trust it; configure nothing.

**pi-agent-core** (`node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-agent-core/dist/`):

- `runAgentLoopContinue(context: AgentContext, config: AgentLoopConfig,
  emit: AgentEventSink, signal: AbortSignal|undefined, streamFn: StreamFn):
  Promise<AgentMessage[]>` — context's last message must be user/toolResult; `emit` is
  awaited at every emission (a durable-persistence barrier).
- `AgentContext {systemPrompt, messages: AgentMessage[], tools?: AgentTool[]}`;
  `AgentLoopConfig extends SimpleStreamOptions {model, convertToLlm (required),
  transformContext?, shouldStopAfterTurn?, getSteeringMessages?, getFollowUpMessages?,
  toolExecution?: "sequential"|"parallel", beforeToolCall?, afterToolCall?, prepareNextTurn?}`.
- `AgentTool {name, label, description, parameters: TSchema,
  execute(toolCallId, params, signal?, onUpdate?): Promise<AgentToolResult>, executionMode?}`;
  `AgentToolResult {content, details, terminate?}`; thrown errors become
  `isError: true` results with the message as text (details lost — hence the error side
  map in §4.3).
- Events: `agent_start/end`, `turn_start/end {message, toolResults}`,
  `message_start/update/end` (`message_update` carries `assistantMessageEvent`),
  `tool_execution_start/update/end`.
- Per-turn ordering: `turn_end` (awaited) → `prepareNextTurn` → `shouldStopAfterTurn` →
  steering/follow-up polls. Error/aborted stop: `turn_end` then `agent_end`, loop returns.
- `StreamFn = (model, context, options?: SimpleStreamOptions) => AssistantMessageEventStream
  | Promise<...>` — must never throw.
